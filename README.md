# CV Parsing Application

This project aims to develop a CV Parsing application using Java Fullstack technologies. The application will extract specific fields from Word/PDF format CVs, including Name, Email ID, Mobile No., Skills, Years of Experience, and Recent 3 Companies.

Roles & Responsibilities:
▪ Developed a CV parsing website using Open AI’s Natural Language Processor (NLP) API, to parse through user resumes ▪ Implemented functionalities such as Admin role for CRUD operations on resume details.
▪ Implemented a login and registration process for users of the parsing website to submit resumes for parsing.


## Requirements

### Backend Development

- Accept Word/PDF format CV files as input.
- Implemented a parser to extract information from the CV files. Since all the resumes do not follow a specific format, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT API) large language models (LLMs) was used to facilitate the parsing of CVs into the required JSON format.
- Extract the following fields from each CV:
  - Name (string): The name of the candidate.
  - Email ID (string): The email address of the candidate.
  - Mobile No. (string): The mobile number of the candidate.
  - Nationality
  - Current location
  - Primary Skills (string or array): The primary skills possessed by the candidate.
  - Secondary Skills (string or array): The secondary skills possessed by the candidate.
  - Years of Experience (number): The number of years of experience of the candidate.
  - Candidate highest qualification
  - Candidate last job title
  - Recent 3 Companies (string or array): The names of the recent 3 companies the candidate has worked for.
  - Every candiate companies detail information (Comany name, Start date, End date, Job title and Responsibilities)
  - Candidate education details (Instituition name, Start date, End date, Qualification)
- Store the extracted information in a database for further processing.
- Implement validation and error handling in the backend.

### Frontend Development

- Create a user interface using a react framework and bootstrap CSS framework
- Implement a drag and drop form input that allows CV in word document or PDF format to be uploaded by users.
- Display the extracted information for each CV, including the fields mentioned above. Allow users to update extracted fields if incorrect.
- Provide search functionality to find candidates based on their name or skills.
- Utilize form validation to ensure correct file formats (Word/PDF) are uploaded.

### Integration

- Connect the frontend and backend by making API calls from the frontend to send CV files and retrieve extracted information.
- Implement error handling and display appropriate error messages to the user when necessary.
- Ensure data consistency between the frontend and backend.

### Features

- Applications accepts 2 main roles
  - Free role
    - As a free subscriber to the application, free user can upload a maximum of 5 CV to be parsed.
  - Paid role
    - As a paid subscriber to the application, paid user can upload unlimited number of CVs to be parsed. User can view all his CVs, filter them based on name or skills. User also have the options to export filtered data to excel or single resume details to excel for further processing.

### Additional Features 

- Admin role
  - As an admin of the application, user have access to all the features available for a paid subscriber. In addition to that, an admin user can view all users resume, filter resumes by name and skills, perform crud functions, export to excel and plot visual statistical charts to facilitate data processing and filtering.
 
- Allow paid and admin users to perform multi-resumes upload
- Added multi-threading feature to optimize parsing of multiple resumes in the backend
- Connected firebase storage backend to store uploaded resumes, which is available for download by users and admin
- Added feature to generate and download custom PDF and word.doc based on extracted resume information
- Users are able to view a preview of the PDF CV attached for single and multi-upload, prior to uploading

## Installation and Setup

To set up the CV Parsing application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies for the frontend using "npm install" and backend components(maven clean install).
3. Set up the backend application properties by configuring the MySQL database setting, server setting and chatGPT api settings.

5. Set up the frontend by configuring the API endpoint and any additional settings.
6. Build the project to compile the source code and generate the necessary files.

Please refer to the project's documentation for detailed installation and setup instructions specific to your chosen technologies.

## Usage

Once the application is set up, follow these steps to use the CV Parsing application:

1. Access the application through a web browser.
2. Upload a Word/PDF format CV file using the provided form.
3. The application will process the file and extract the relevant information.
4. The extracted information will be displayed on the user interface. User can update errorous extracted information.
5. Use the search functionality to find candidates based on their name or skills.
6. Explore any additional features, such as exporting the data or viewing visualizations.
